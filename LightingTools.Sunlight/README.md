# LightingTools : Sunlight

Sunlight entity for unity and HD Render Pipeline.

Settings on the sunlight are the default settings.

Settings at runtime come from Time of day manager, time of day is a global variable.

Some of the properties can be overriden by Volume (local or global, they interpolate).

Comes with a timeline track. The timeline clips don't have the best editor, they can only override settings overriden in a volume.
